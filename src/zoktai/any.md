# Boktai 2 (JP) Any% Route

## About this guide

This guide assumes you are playing on the Japanese 1.0 release of Boktai 2.  
It will likely work fine for other releases but some strategies like RNG manipulation will need different timings.  
Directions for paths and exits will use ↖️, ↗️, ↙️ and ↘️.

### Terminology

- RNG manip: Short for "Random Number Generator Manipulation". Used to influence the randomness within the game to make things happen that are normally reliant on chance.
- Soft reset: Pressing A + B + Start & Select at the same time reboots the game. This is useful for RNG manip and can be used to skip dragging coffins back to town.
- STRG and AGIL: Strength and Agility. The third and fourth status point options. They influence your physical damage, movement speed and defense.

### Emulator settings

- Requires BizHawk 2.6.3 or newer.

Setting "Skip BIOS" is mandatory as this creates parity with actual hardware.  
Disabling RTC simulates an empty cartridge battery which enables some of the strats in this guide.
