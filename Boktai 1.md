# Boktai 1 Normal 2 Any%

## About this Guide

This Guide is intended for the Japanese version of Boktai: The Sun is in your Hands and the Normal 2 Any% Category. It should work exactly the same for other versions but JP is significantly faster.  
Credits go to the entire [Taiyoh Network Community](https://discord.gg/0dUb9OmJrIrRPFGf) and many casual players that discovered strats on accident.

### Videos

Each section of the run has a video attached to it that shows that section being played. Watch those videos for chests, pathing and enemies that need to be killed as that will be omitted from the text description.  
The strats shown in the videos are ideal scenarios, don’t worry if a trap or boss fight doesn’t work out exactly as shown.

### Solar Gauge

A recommendation on which sun strength to use for that dungeon to prevent overheat and ensure you reach the required dungeon rank where necessary. For purifications you can ignore that recommendation and always go for max.

## Before the run

Set Date and Time on Console:

- 2003 年 07 月 17 日
- 午前 04時 00分

If you want to play on an emulator, currently only mGBA and BizHawk are allowed.
In the case of BizHawk, you should use at least version 2.6.3 since that adds the ability to emulate an empty cartridge battery.

### BizHawk

- GBA > Settings > Sync Settings:
  - Set “Skip BIOS” to “False”
  - Set “RTC use Real Time” to “False”
  - Set “RTC” to “False”
- Then use the in-game time option to set:
  - 2003 年 07 月 17 日
  - 午前 04時 00分

### mGBA

- TODO: instructions on how to set up mGBA
- Then use the in-game time option to set:
  - 2003 年 07 月 17 日
  - 午前 04時 00分

With this starting time you will

- get Ghouls during Fog Castle, sunlight will kill them immediately, and they will most likely drop healing items.
- get better enemies in Firetop Mountain.
- reach Delusion Forest during the early morning.

Optional on Emulator: Increase the Light on the Start Screen (visualised by Sun animation speed)

To start a new run

- Create a new save file,
- reduce the name to one character,
- keep the default region setting,
- select your Difficulty (keep in mind that every Difficulty is a separate Category, this guide is made for the default setting, Normal 2),
- start the timer when confirming on the Summary Screen.

Extra info

- Showing the Ranking Screen after the credits is preferred

## Intro

Once you gain control, pause the game and set the text speed to “Fast”. Optionally you can also turn off markers which can reduce lag.  
Inputs needed to change the text speed and disable the markers:

- start, down, down, A, down, right, down, right, A, B
Text speed saves about 3-4 seconds, for markers we don’t have data.
